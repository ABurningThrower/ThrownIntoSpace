Things to work on:
	
		FUNCTIONALITY
	Storing data (has player logged in? Who is the player? settings)
	Music player
	Combat Scene
	Dice roller in combat w/ animations
	BDiS DM to allow getting into combat + playing scenes
	Make Combat Scene + Non-Combat Actions Scene
	Move customs to user:// so as to not have to reset it each time
	
	
		SCENES
	Freespace - moved Notepad + Whiteboard into here
	Char Sheet - Make this an ID-looking thing, with pfp instead of full (get full if you click on the pfp), with summary details on front side (with some buttons to expand for more details) and flippable back side with more niche details| displays user's character, including their stats and inventory
	Crew - shows all characters permanently in party, along with the ship and warframes (ship scene shows ship inventory)
	** Notepad - notepad with either tab or folder view (or both?), with some other features later like bbcode, color support, or timestamps?
	
	!Music player (Song name, length, tags)
	
	
		AESTHETIC
	Sidebar animation
	Graphic design/theming (i.e. Karma or Crew.tscn)
	Dice animation fx (i.e. glow effects on 20 w/ good sfx, and vice versa for nat 1)
	Shaders?
