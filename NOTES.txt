Current TODO:
	
	Consider switching  transition button presses to be inside of transitionButton.gd instead of Scene Manager (signals? groups?)
	
	
	Inventory + Icons
	Music Player Icon Pack (make the UI)
	
	build settings and 
	brainstorm what things need to be saved





Things to work on:
	
		FUNCTIONALITY

	Dice roller in combat w/ animations
	BDiS DM to allow getting into combat + playing scenes
	Combat Scene + Non-Combat Actions Scene
	
	
	
		SCENES
	Freespace - moved Notepad + Whiteboard into here
	Char Sheet - Make this an ID-looking thing, with pfp instead of full (get full if you click on the pfp), with summary details on front side (with some buttons to expand for more details) and flippable back side with more niche details| displays user's character, including their stats and inventory
	Crew - shows all characters permanently in party, along with the ship and warframes (ship scene shows ship inventory)
	** Notepad - notepad with either tab or folder view (or both?), with some other features later like bbcode, color support, or timestamps?
	
	!Music player (Song name, length, tags)
	
	
		AESTHETIC
	Add some extra details to #warframe_license? (i.e. manufacture date, serial codes, purchase date, etc.)
	Add page flip texture to texturebutton in #warframe_license
	make #character_id :sob:
	make the lines in #settings round circle in center then thin out towards the end? (or something else that actually looks nice; probably also add gradience/fadeout with thickness [i.e. thicker = full opacity, vice versa])
	
	Sidebar animation
	Graphic design/theming (set font in main_theme.tres + overrides/other themes )
	Dice animation fx (i.e. glow effects on 20 w/ good sfx, and vice versa for nat 1)
	On hover over buttons in #warframe, start an expanding glow effect after a teensy delay, which fades back out when no longer hovered over.
	Shaders?
	Animation/shader for music player (i.e. chance to static flicker when it shows up?)
	
	#N/A - can you change the text by the checkbox in a bool @export var? ("On" by default)





		=Sprites for items (IDs and licenses)
		=ID ref pic for charID scene
		

		#settings - be able to set: default scene, audio, 
		#warframe_license


	To touch on next:
		*inventory - look at this slop (wallet)
		*freespace/Whiteboard - signal optimization?
		#freespace - improve eraser?
		#freespace f(_on_whiteboard_vis_btn_toggled) - signals here?
		#
		#
		#
		*battle_actions + enemy_data - get reference on how this should look (Baldur's Gate); refactor later
		#wf_license   - get reference
		#character_id - get reference
		#combat       - get reference
		#
		#
		#
		#
		#
		*loginButton - add os mismatch elif
		#inventory - possible to bold item name in tooltips?
		#inventory - continue prettifying wallet
		#settings  - visual improvements?
		#warframes - visual improvements?
